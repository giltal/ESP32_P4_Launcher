# ESP32-P4 Launcher — Project Context

Launcher firmware for ESP32-P4 boards that loads **relocatable PAPP v2 apps** from the SD card into
PSRAM and runs them with a DLL-style interface layer. Successor to the PAPP concept in
`C:\ESPIDFprojects\RetroESP32_P4` (reference project: drivers, ports, history).

Design: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Plan + status: `docs/WORKPLAN.md`.

## Layout

```
launcher/                 ESP-IDF project (factory app; main.c + home.c = LVGL home screen + app folders; store.c = the Store,
                          first home tile: categories, app pages, install/update/remove; home_ui.h = what it uses from home.c). Board: -DLX_BOARD=<id> (default guition_p4_43)
boards/<id>/board/        BSP implementation (component "board", pins esp_hosted for its C6); boards/<id>/sdkconfig.board.
                          guition_p4_43 (4.3" 480x800, image "launcher"; guition_p4_43_v3 = same sources built for
                          rev v3.x chips, BOARD_CHIP_V3 picks the id), guition_p4_7 (7" 1024x600), m5stack_tab5 (720x1280,
                          power rails on two PI4IOE5V6408 I2C expanders, esp_hosted 1.4 for M5Stack's C6 firmware),
                          waveshare_p4_rpi_dsi (Waveshare dev kit + RPi Touch Display V1-style 800x480 panel: TC358762, ATTINY88
                          power/backlight at 0x45, FT5x06 touch; RGB565 shadow buffers converted to the RGB888 scan-out
                          by the PPA, docs/PORT_WAVESHARE_P4.md), elecrow_p4_aio (Elecrow All-in-one Starter Kit SEE00804D:
                          7" 1024x600 EK79007, scan direction on GPIO 32/33 = rotation 0, I2S amp without codec (software
                          volume), 1-bit SD, ADC button ladder, C6 on SDIO slot 1 with the kit's pins; untested,
                          docs/PORT_ELECROW_AIO.md)
components/bsp/           BSP contract (bsp.h) — the core only talks to hardware through it
components/papp_abi/      papp_abi.h — .papp v2 format + interfaces (shared with apps; no IDF includes)
components/lx_loader/     App Manager: loader, relocation, imports, services (SYS/MEM/FS/DISP/AUDI/INPT/THRD/UI/NET/BLE), teardown;
                          MEM v2 code_alloc/code_free/code_sync = executable PSRAM for JITs (64 KB blocks mapped a second time
                          with EXEC; esp_mmu_map runs on an internal-stack helper task, it disables the caches);
                          NET (lx_svc_net.c) = Wi-Fi, sockets, TLS, HTTP(S) for apps: the first call holds the radio
                          for the run (lx_net_app_hold), every wait gives up on exit, teardown closes sockets and rejoins the saved network;
                          BLE (lx_svc_ble.c) = NimBLE on the P4, controller on the C6 over esp_hosted (VHCI): the host
                          starts on the first call (gatt_register restarts it with the app's table) and stops at teardown;
                          Guition boards, Tab5 and waveshare_p4_rpi_dsi (CONFIG_BT_* in their sdkconfig.board; on Tab5's esp_hosted 1.4
                          the C6 runs its controller from boot, lx_svc_ble.c stubs the 2.x controller calls; waveshare_p4_rpi_dsi needs
                          the release's C6 firmware), the slot is NULL on the Waveshare 3.5"
components/fatfs/         copy of IDF 5.5.6's fatfs with exFAT on (FF_FS_EXFAT 1, + FF_USE_LABEL fix): overrides IDF's;
                          README_LAUNCHER.md = the changes, to redo when moving to another IDF version
components/lx_devlink/    DevLink: framed protocol over USB-Serial-JTAG (devlink_proto.h)
components/lx_common/     crc32, launcher version; lx_zip = zipped ROMs (central directory + the chip ROM's miniz tinfl):
                          an app opening "dir/X.nes" that isn't there gets the .nes member of "dir/X.zip" (lx_services.c
                          fs_open/fs_size): unpacked into PSRAM behind fopencookie, or for .gba/too big into
                          /sd/launcher/zipcache (latest only, source.txt = what it holds); lx_ui's browser lists .zip for
                          emulators whose extensions lack it and hands over the virtual name (saves follow it, recents keep the .zip)
components/lx_gfx/        software drawing + 8x16 font for launcher screens (rotation-aware)
components/lx_comp/       compositor: app surfaces → PPA scale/rotate → panel; launcher screens draw via it;
                          present is async with 2 buffers (task "lx_present" scales + flips while the app runs;
                          present_ext copies the app's frame into the spare buffer first), synchronous with 1 buffer
components/lx_audio/      audio engine: per-stream rings → resample → mix → BSP codec (fixed rate)
components/lx_ui/         launcher-drawn screens for apps: content browser (pick_file) + message box; UI v4 wifi() = Wi-Fi picker
                          (scan list, password keyboard, joins with lx_net_connect = saved to wifi.txt; lx_net_restore on fail/cancel)
components/lx_input/      input manager: USB HID gamepads/keyboards, XInput (Xbox 360) pads (lx_input_xinput) + board buttons (merged into P1) → players + event queue; HOME chord;
                          lx_hid_parse = HID descriptor parser; lx_padmap = per-pad button mapping as text on the card:
                          /sd/config/gamepads_mine.txt (Map controller) wins over /sd/config/gamepads.txt (shared database,
                          SDcard/config/gamepads.txt, downloaded by the Store); NVS "padmap" = pre-0.23, read-only fallback
components/lx_update/     self-update from /sd/update/launcher.bin + rollback confirm; online update (latest.json);
                          lx_appstore = app catalogue for the Store (apps.json on the "apps" release; icons cached in /sd/launcher/store)
components/lx_net/        Wi-Fi station, NTP, time zone via the ESP32-C6 (esp_hosted 2.12.13 on the Guition boards and waveshare_p4_rpi_dsi, 1.4 on Tab5 and the Waveshare 3.5");
                          lx_c6 = the C6's firmware: version (DevLink info c6_fw) and update from /sd/update/c6.bin or the release;
                          saved network = /sd/config/wifi.txt (ssid=/password= lines; NVS "net" = pre-0.24, moved to the card at boot)
                          join = all-channel scan, strongest AP of the SSID (mesh/repeaters share one); no address 20 s after joining = rejoin
components/lx_web/        Wi-Fi file manager: web page for the SD card, on request, with a PIN per start
papp-sdk/                 App SDK: include/papp/papp.h, runtime/ (crt0, libc glue), ld/papp.ld,

## Environment

- ESP-IDF v5.5.6 at `C:\Users\97254\esp\v5.5.6\esp-idf` (5.5.2 still installed beside it); in PowerShell: `. .\tools\idf_env.ps1`
- Python with pyserial + pyelftools: `C:\Users\97254\.espressif\python_env\idf5.5_py3.12_env\Scripts\python.exe`
- Boards (both chip rev v1.x, `CONFIG_ESP32P4_SELECTS_REV_LESS_V3`); USB-Serial-JTAG belongs to DevLink, UART0 is the text console:
  Guition 4.3" `guition_p4_43` on **COM9** (build in `launcher/build`), Guition 7" JC1060P470C `guition_p4_7` on **COM10**
  (`idf.py -B build_guition_p4_7 -DLX_BOARD=guition_p4_7 -p COM10 build flash`). Porting: `docs/PORTING_GUIDE.md`.
  M5Stack Tab5 `m5stack_tab5` on **COM15** (`-B build_m5stack_tab5`; image "launcher_m5stack_tab5").
  Waveshare `waveshare_p4_rpi_dsi` (`-B build_waveshare_p4_rpi_dsi`; image "launcher_waveshare_p4_rpi_dsi"), tested on Linux:
  /dev/ttyACM0 = CH343 UART console and flashing, /dev/ttyACM1 = USB-Serial-JTAG (DevLink). Open the console without
  changing DTR/RTS (that resets the board); USB host works on the lower USB-A port only (no hub TT in IDF).
  `managed_components/` is shared and esp_hosted differs per board: after building another board, add `reconfigure`.
  launcher/CMakeLists.txt turns off the component manager's new-version check (newer esp_hosted releases broke configure).
  Every managed component is pinned to an exact version in the idf_component.yml files (dependencies.lock is not in git,
  it differs per board): a self-built launcher matches the release. Other ESP-IDF versions get a configure warning. 5.5.6 since launcher 0.25.3 (v3.x chips need >= 5.5.5).
  `papp_dev.py bootlog` shows what the board logged before DevLink came up (bring-up of a new board).

## Dev loop (works without touching the board)

```powershell
cd launcher; idf.py -p COM9 build flash; cd ..                     # launcher (only when it changes)
python papp-sdk\tools\papp_build.py --name hello --src apps\hello\main.c [--libc]
python tools\papp_dev.py --port COM9 deploy build\apps\hello\hello.papp --timeout 20 -- arg1
python tools\papp_dev.py --port COM9 crash --elf build\apps\hello\hello.elf    # after a panic reboot
python tests\host\test_reloc.py                                               # packer/relocator check
```

Apps in `/sd/apps/<dir>/<file>.papp` appear on the home screen; a directory there with no `.papp` is a folder of apps (its own `icon.png` optional)
(`/sd/apps/<folder>/<dir>/<file>.papp`, one level; `deploy` finds an app moved into one). Icon: an `icon.png` in the app's source
folder (PNG, square, best 88x88, transparency OK; corners are rounded by the launcher) is copied by
`papp_build.py` and uploaded by `deploy` to `/sd/apps/<dir>/icon.png`; without one the tile shows the initial.
`deploy` into a folder also uploads the folder's icon (`apps/common/icons/folder_<folder>.png`) when the folder has none. Every `papp_dev.py`
command also sets the board clock from the PC (`--no-time` skips it; `info` shows `time` and `rtc`).
`deploy` = upload to `/sd/apps/<name>/<name>.papp` → run → stream logs → exit code of the app
(124 timeout). `shot out.png` = screenshot of the visible framebuffer, in landscape (open it to see
the screen). Other commands: `info ls stat put get rm mkdir mv run stop status log reboot crash-clear`;
`net [--quick|--scan]` = network self-test on the board (link, pings, TCP, DNS, nearby networks).
Input without touching the board: `input state [--watch 10]`, `input pad A+START [--hold ms]`,
`input key ENTER`, `input text "hi"`, or timed during a run: `deploy app.papp --inject 500:pad:A --inject 900:text:hi`.

## Rules

- Apps never include ESP-IDF headers; launcher core never includes board headers.
- New interface functions are **appended** and the interface version bumped; breaking change = new id.
- Every service entry point uses `SVC_ENTER/SVC_LEAVE` (forced stop waits for it) and tracks what it
  creates so teardown can reclaim it.
- SD transfers need 64-byte-aligned DMA buffers, or they run a sector at a time at 1.5 MB/s: launcher code that
  reads whole files uses `lx_file_fast_io` (free its buffer after `fclose`).
- `CONFIG_LX_APP_TEST_BASE_SHIFT_PAGES` must be 0 in normal builds (relocation test aid).
- Flash writes (NVS, OTA) must run on a task with an internal stack, never on an app thread: PSRAM stacks abort.
- After temporarily editing and restoring a source file, touch it: an old timestamp keeps the stale object.
- `ESP_SYSTEM_PMP_IDRAM_SPLIT` stays off (FAST region needs executable heap SRAM). After copying an
  sdkconfig file back, touch it: an old timestamp makes the build silently keep the previous config.
- Commit/push only when asked.
